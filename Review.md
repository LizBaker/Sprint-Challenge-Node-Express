# Review Questions

## What is Node.js?

javascript that can run outside of the browser

## What is Express?

a node.js framework that is especially helpful for making APIs

## Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

routing and middleware

## What is Middleware?

middleware are functions that can be applied to adjust the environment

## What is a Resource?

I don't really know or remember this being a term. I guess it's like the data you're using? like the users resource has 5 endpoints, so.. the db of the users?

## What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

a success status/message

## How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

file organization, routing

## What is express.json() and why do we need it?

I (think) it parses JS into JSON. JSON is a lightweight way to transfer info in object/array/string formats. but unlike JS objects, JSON objects are strings, string-objects? Cloudy on this one
